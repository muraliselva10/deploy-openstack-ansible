# Ansible Playbook: Openstack

An ansible playbook to deploy openstack components to the cluster
# Overview
The playbook is composed according to [official openstack guides](http://docs.openstack.org/mitaka/install-guide-rdo/) 
with a primary purpose to learn openstack deployment in a nutshell. Another reason is to fill the gap between official 
[full-fledged](https://github.com/openstack/openstack-ansible) and 
[devel](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/openstack-ansible/developer-docs/quickstart-aio.html) deployment guides. 
At the current state the playbook is able to deploy a fully functional openstack cluster.
Also it's possible to deploy everything on a single(VM) host.
Also please read requirements section carefully.

# Description
#### The playbook is able to setup the core services described in the [official guide](http://docs.openstack.org/mitaka/install-guide-rdo/):
* **keystone**
* **glance**
* **cinder**
* **nova**
* **neutron**
* **heat**
* **ceilometer**
* **horizon**

The configuration is _very_ simple:

Itâ€™s only required to place hostname(s) to the **controller** and **compute** groups in [hosts](hosts) file and carefully fill the required 
[group_vars](group_vars/all) parameters.

The playbook contains configuration files in roles directories. If you need to add or change any parameter you can edit
the configuration file which can be found in **roles/_service_/[files|templates]** directory.

# Configuration
Service configuration performed using the hosts file. The empty [hosts](hosts) file is supplied with the playbook.
**You must not remove any existing group**. Leave the group empty if you don't need services the group configures. The same hostname can be placed to any hosts group.
As an instance if you want setup everything on one host, just put the same hostname to each hosts group.
As far, only **controller** and **compute** groups are well tested and supported.

#### Variables parameters:
Please see [group_vars/all](group_vars/all) and supply appropriate configuration for the required networking and disk partition parameters.
